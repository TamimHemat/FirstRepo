        <strong><p>I was born in Sofia in the year 2002 on 3-rd of June. I am a Gemini - the BEST sign even though I know a lot of people will not agree :D.</p>
        <p>I have always had huge interest in sciences and mathematics. I have also always had interest in computers.</p>
        <p>Websites have never really been my strong side, but that is maybe because I've never tried to put in the work.
        But now since I am in BCIT and I am very dedicated, I know that I will learn a lot of new skills that will forever be useful.</p>
        <p>I plan on finishing this program and then going back to Europe to pursue a carrier there.</p>
        <p>In Europe, Canadian and Amreican post-secondary education is very highly valued and people who do habe it
        have a very easy time finding a good job with a lot of opportunities and perspectives.</p>
        <p>Midterms are soon so I will focus on them for now. After that I am willing to put in some good work into my website.</p></strong>
